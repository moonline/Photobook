## Commands

Install dependencies:
```bash
cd "app";
npm install
```
Run the app:
```bash
npm start
```
You need to save a code file to trigger a rebuild once the applications launched to load it properly.

Use "Open" to open a json-photobook file. The import will take some time.
When you change code files, the app will reload and the last opened file will automatically be loaded (be patient ;-) ).
